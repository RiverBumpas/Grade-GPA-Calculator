**Summary:**  
Our program is a GPA calculator. The user is prompted to choose between calculating a final grade for a course in a number of steps, or manually inputting the final grade they received in a course if they have already received one.
Once all the final grades and their credit values are set, the program will calculate a GPA and return it to the user.  
**Topics used from module two:**  
Inheritance (has-a relationship), file output, and component class.  
**Bugs:**  
No known bugs at the time of submission.  
**Grade Earned:**  
We feel that we have earned 75 points with this project. We have a very well functioning and complex main file, a well-organized and robust testing file, a Has-A relationship, and file output.
