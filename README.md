-change input fields to receive input from website
-2 options to calculate like we had it before
-unsure how we can incorporate command line argument
-potentially split c++ file into python file to do subprocesses? or html -> php -> python -> c++
-use matplotlib to display graphical data of grades??
-if we have time implement more logic to predict a final grade
  ex. "i have ____ grade currently, what would I need to get on this assignment (check weight) to receive ___ final grade"
